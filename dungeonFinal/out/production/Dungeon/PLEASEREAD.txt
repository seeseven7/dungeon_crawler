I kept getting an error regarding JUNIT tests where it kept saying that the library didn't exist.
I tried fixing it through plugins, installing dependencies, and tweaking around the IntelliJ setting.
I ended up just leaving the tests there, but without actually running them.

Thank you for your understanding,
